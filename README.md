# Poker
This project is an implementation of Poker Hold'em game in Java.



## My work each week

- **S41** : Improvement of CardPacket. Creation of the Button and Hand interface. Add implementation and tests of Hand interface with HandConcrete. I've created the enum Chip and a method to get all chip values.
- **S40** : Create structure from the class diagram. Add a way to generate a card packet (generate all cards and a way to permute cards). Add a function to get the first card of the packet. Start tests of the CardPacket.
